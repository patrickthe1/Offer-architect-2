## ⚠️ **Current Limitations & Scope Decisions**

### **🔒 Authentication & User Management**
**Status:** Not implemented  
**Rationale:** With a 2-day development window, we prioritized demonstrating the core AI methodology over user infrastructure. Building robust authentication would have consumed significant development time without showcasing the unique value proposition.

**What this means:**
- No user accounts or login system
- No personal data collection or storage
- Each session is independent and temporary

### **💾 Database & Data Persistence**
**Status:** Not implemented  
**Rationale:** We focused on perfecting the AI guidance experience rather than data storage. The core innovation is the strategic methodology, not data management.

**What this means:**
- No offer history or saved projects
- No user profile creation or management
- Results exist only during the current session

### **🔄 Session Management**
**Status:** Basic browser session only  
**Rationale:** Advanced session management would require backend infrastructure that doesn't demonstrate our core AI capabilities.

**What this means:**
- Progress resets if browser is refreshed
- No cross-device synchronization
- No collaborative features or sharing

### **📊 Analytics & Tracking**
**Status:** Not implemented  
**Rationale:** Business intelligence features would be built after validating the core methodology works effectively.

**What this means:**
- No usage analytics or success metrics
- No A/B testing of different guidance approaches
- No user behavior analysis

2. Responses can be synthesized into actionable insights
3. The guided experience feels premium and valuable
4. Results are comprehensive and professional

### **Time Investment Priorities**
With only **48 hours** available, we allocated development time to maximum impact areas:

**🚀 70% - AI Methodology & Prompting**
- Perfecting the guided question system
- Optimizing AI responses for strategic value
- Ensuring comprehensive offer synthesis

**🎨 20% - User Experience Design**
- Premium interface that feels professional
- Intuitive workflow that guides users naturally
- Visual elements that reinforce value proposition

**🔧 10% - Technical Infrastructure**
- Stable API integration with error handling
- Reliable frontend-backend communication
- Basic deployment and demo readiness
