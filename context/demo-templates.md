```
Struggling SaaS founders burning through runway with no clear path to profitability, constantly stressed about running out of money, making desperate pricing decisions that hurt their business long-term
```

Lack the internal expertise to interpret the data correctly, get overwhelmed by information without knowing which metrics actually matter for their stage of business
```

```
Done-for-you financial dashboard templates specific to their business model, automated alerts for the 5 critical metrics that actually predict SaaS success

```
Direct access to SaaS CFOs who've scaled companies from $1M to $100M ARR, private case studies of successful pivots during financial crises

My challenge is justifying premium pricing when cheaper alternatives exist, but I want to attract serious founders who value transformation over cost.
